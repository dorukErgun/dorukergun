      <div className="pt-5 w-1/2">
        I have started developing web applications in 2019 while trying to figure out college. Fell in love with it, never stopped since.
        I had the pleasure of working with people from around the world on various projects. 
        I am currently working as a Software Engineer.
        <br/><br/>
        I have been working with React, Next.js, Node.js, Angular, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and other technologies developing Banking, 
        E-Commerce, and other web applications serving thousands of users.
        <br/><br/>
        My main focus is to build products using the latest technologies and make people&apos;s lives easier with friendly ✨UI&apos;s and UX&apos;s✨.
